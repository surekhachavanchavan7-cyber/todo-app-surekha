# To-Do List Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple and interactive **To-Do List Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The goal of this project is to allow users to easily add, edit, delete, and manage daily tasks.  
The application is responsive and stores tasks in the browser using **LocalStorage**, so data remains saved even after refreshing the page.
